## Title of the original tutorial paper "ASMETA tool set for rigorous system design" submitted at the 26th International Symposium on Formal Methods (FM 2024) - Tutorial track

This document contains the steps to be followed to reproduce the tutorialâ€™s claims.

## Software installation
Step 1: Download the .zip file containing the Asmeta tools available [here](https://zenodo.org/records/11955939) depending on your system:

* [eclipse_asmeta_smv_2024_06_win64.zip](https://zenodo.org/records/11955939/files/eclipse_asmeta_smv_2024_06_win64.zip?download=1) 
* [eclipse_asmeta_smv_2024_06_linux_x86_64.zip](https://zenodo.org/records/11955939/files/eclipse_asmeta_smv_2024_06_linux_x86_64.zip?download=1) 
* [eclipse_asmeta_smv_2024_06_macOs_aarch64.zip](https://zenodo.org/records/11955939/files/eclipse_asmeta_smv_2024_06_macOs_aarch64.zip?download=1) 

Step 2: Unzip the content

Step 3: Run the file in the main folder depending on your OS:

* win64: *asmeta_win64.bat*
* linux_x86_64: *asmeta_linux64.sh*
* macOs_aarch64: *asmeta_macOs_install.sh* and *asmeta_macOs_run.sh*

Eclipse is now running and in the workspace there are two projects:
* *STDL* containing the Asmeta libraries
* *tutorial_FM24* containing the Asmeta models of the Pill-Box Case Study

For other platforms, instead, we provide an update site that can be used to install all the required plugins in any Eclipse version. Then the projects *STDL* and *tutorial_FM24* can be downloaded and imported in Eclipse from [here](https://github.com/asmeta/asmeta/tree/master/asmeta_models).


In the following, we will explain the steps to use the Asmeta tools on the *pillbox_ground.asm* model.

## Model Simulation

Step 4: Open the *pillbox_ground.asm* model in the Eclipse editor then run the specification iteratively in the console using ![run_asmeta_model](images/run_asm_tool.png) button.

Let's assume that we want to simulate the scenario in Fig. 5 of the paper: *the pill in drawer 1 hits the deadline (in State 0), so the pill becomes to be taken (State 1), the led becomes ON (State 2), the user takes the pill, and the led becomes OFF (State 3)*.
The set of inputs (monitored functions) is the following:
* State 0:
  * pillDeadlineHit(drawer1) = true
  * pillDeadlineHit(drawer2) = false
  * pillDeadlineHit(drawer3) = false
