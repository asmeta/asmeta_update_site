## Title of the original tutorial paper "ASMETA tool set for rigorous system design" submitted at the 26th International Symposium on Formal Methods (FM 2024) - Tutorial track

This document contains the steps to be followed to reproduce the tutorialâ€™s claims.

This contains operative steps, to know more about the theory and the behavior please read the tutorial paper.

## Software installation
**Step 1**: Download the .zip file containing the Asmeta tools available [here](https://zenodo.org/records/11955939) depending on your system:

* [eclipse_asmeta_smv_2024_06_win64.zip](https://zenodo.org/records/11955939/files/eclipse_asmeta_smv_2024_06_win64.zip?download=1) 
* [eclipse_asmeta_smv_2024_06_linux_x86_64.zip](https://zenodo.org/records/11955939/files/eclipse_asmeta_smv_2024_06_linux_x86_64.zip?download=1) 
* [eclipse_asmeta_smv_2024_06_macOs_aarch64.zip](https://zenodo.org/records/11955939/files/eclipse_asmeta_smv_2024_06_macOs_aarch64.zip?download=1) 

**Step 2**: Unzip the content

**Step 3**: Run the file in the main folder depending on your OS:

* win64: *asmeta_win64.bat*
* linux_x86_64: *asmeta_linux64.sh*
* macOs_aarch64: *asmeta_macOs_install.sh* and *asmeta_macOs_run.sh*

Eclipse is now running and in the workspace there are two projects:
* *STDL* containing the Asmeta libraries
* *tutorial_FM24* containing the Asmeta models of the Pill-Box Case Study

For other platforms, instead, we provide an update site that can be used to install all the required plugins in any Eclipse version. Then the projects *STDL* and *tutorial_FM24* can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/asmeta/asmeta/tree/master/asmeta_models) and imported into Eclipse.


In the following, we will explain the steps to use the Asmeta tools on the *pillbox_ground.asm* model, the same steps can be followed for the other models.

## Model Simulation: AsmetaS

### Interactive Simulation

**Step 1**: Uncheck the following two options in "Window -> Preferences -> Asmeta -> Simulator":

* Stop simulation if the update set is empty
* Stop simulation if the update set is trivial

**Step 2**: Open the *pillbox_ground.asm* model in the Eclipse editor then run the specification iteratively in the console using ![run_asmeta_model](images/run_asm_tool.png) button.

Let's assume that we want to simulate the scenario in Fig. 5 of the paper: *the pill in drawer 1 hits the deadline (in State 0), so the pill becomes to be taken (State 1), the led becomes ON (State 2), the user takes the pill, and the led becomes OFF (State 3)*.
In the following are listed the current state, the **inputs to be set** in the console, and the updated functions.

**Step 3**:  State 0

  Current state:
  * drawerLed(drawer1) = OFF
  * drawerLed(drawer2) = OFF
  * drawerLed(drawer3) = OFF
  * isPillTobeTaken(drawer1) = true
  * isPillTobeTaken(drawer2) = false
  * isPillTobeTaken(drawer3) = false

  Inputs (monitored functions) to be set in the console (the order may change):
  * pillDeadlineHit(drawer1) = true
  * pillDeadlineHit(drawer2) = false
  * pillDeadlineHit(drawer3) = false
 
  Update set:
  * isPillTobeTaken(drawer1)=true
 
 **Step 4**: State 1

   Current state:
   * drawerLed(drawer1) = OFF
   * drawerLed(drawer2) = OFF
   * drawerLed(drawer3) = OFF
   * isPillTobeTaken(drawer1) = true
   * isPillTobeTaken(drawer2) = false
   * isPillTobeTaken(drawer3) = false
    
   Inputs (monitored functions) to be set in the console (the order may change):
   * pillDeadlineHit(drawer1) = false
   * pillDeadlineHit(drawer2) = false
   * pillDeadlineHit(drawer3) = false
 
   Update set:
   * drawerLed(drawer1) = ON

**Step 5**: State 2

  Current state:
  * drawerLed(drawer1) = ON
  * drawerLed(drawer2) = OFF
  * drawerLed(drawer3) = OFF
  * isPillTobeTaken(drawer1) = true
  * isPillTobeTaken(drawer2) = false
  * isPillTobeTaken(drawer3) = false
     
  Inputs (monitored functions) to be set in the console (the order may change)::
  * pillDeadlineHit(drawer1) = false
  * pillDeadlineHit(drawer2) = false
  * pillDeadlineHit(drawer3) = false
  * isPillTaken(drawer1) = true

  Update set:
   * isPillTobeTaken(drawer1) = false
   * drawerLed(drawer1) = OFF

 **Step 6**: State 3
   
   Current state:
   * drawerLed(drawer1)=OFF
   * drawerLed(drawer2)=OFF
   * drawerLed(drawer3)=OFF
   * isPillTobeTaken(drawer1)=false
   * isPillTobeTaken(drawer2)=false
   * isPillTobeTaken(drawer3)=false
  
To simulate other scenarios use different inputs.

### Random Simulation

**Step 1**: Open the *pillbox_ground.asm* model in the Eclipse editor then run the specification randomly in the console using ![run_asmeta_model](images/run_rnd.png) button.

The inputs are randomly chosen, and the simulation is displayed in the console.

## Model Animation: AsmetaA

### Interactive Animation

**Step 1**: Open the *pillbox_ground.asm* model in the Eclipse editor then run the specification using the animator by pressing the ![run_asmeta_model](images/runAnimatorInt.png) button.

Let's assume that we want to animate the scenario in Fig. 6 of the paper (which is the same as the simulation): *the pill in drawer 1 hits the deadline (in State 0), so the pill becomes to be taken (State 1), the led becomes ON (State 2), the user takes the pill, and the led becomes OFF (State 3)*.
In the following are listed the **inputs to be set** in the windows that appear to acquire inputs.

**Step 2**: State 0

  Current state:
  * drawerLed(drawer1) = OFF
  * drawerLed(drawer2) = OFF
  * drawerLed(drawer3) = OFF
  * isPillTobeTaken(drawer1) = true
  * isPillTobeTaken(drawer2) = false
  * isPillTobeTaken(drawer3) = false
  
  Press  *"Do one interactive step"* button in the animator and set the following inputs:
  * pillDeadlineHit(drawer1) = true
  * pillDeadlineHit(drawer2) = false
  * pillDeadlineHit(drawer3) = false

**Step 3**: State 1

 Current state:
   * drawerLed(drawer1) = OFF
   * drawerLed(drawer2) = OFF
   * drawerLed(drawer3) = OFF
   * isPillTobeTaken(drawer1) = true
   * isPillTobeTaken(drawer2) = false
   * isPillTobeTaken(drawer3) = false
    
   Press  *"Do one interactive step"* button in the animator and set the following inputs:
   * pillDeadlineHit(drawer1) = false
   * pillDeadlineHit(drawer2) = false
   * pillDeadlineHit(drawer3) = false

 **Step 4**: State 2

   Current state:
  * drawerLed(drawer1) = ON
  * drawerLed(drawer2) = OFF
  * drawerLed(drawer3) = OFF
  * isPillTobeTaken(drawer1) = true
  * isPillTobeTaken(drawer2) = false
  * isPillTobeTaken(drawer3) = false
     
  Press  *"Do one interactive step"* button in the animator and set the following inputs:
  * pillDeadlineHit(drawer1) = false
  * pillDeadlineHit(drawer2) = false
  * pillDeadlineHit(drawer3) = false
  * isPillTaken(drawer1) = true

**Step 5**: State 3
   
   Current state:
   * drawerLed(drawer1)=OFF
   * drawerLed(drawer2)=OFF
   * drawerLed(drawer3)=OFF
   * isPillTobeTaken(drawer1)=false
   * isPillTobeTaken(drawer2)=false
   * isPillTobeTaken(drawer3)=false

After following these steps, this is the output in the animator, where light-blue background means that it is the initial value of functions, and green background means that the function value has changed:

 ![run_asmeta_animator](images/asmetaA_run.png)
 
To animate other scenarios use different inputs.

### Random Animation

**Step 1**: Open the *pillbox_ground.asm* model in the Eclipse editor then run the specification using the animator by pressing the ![run_asmeta_model](images/runAnimatorInt.png) button.

**Step 2**: Press  *"Do random step/s"* button in the animator. The specification is executed with a random set of inputs.

The specification can be animated randomly step by step or more steps can be automatically randomly executed by setting the number of steps in the text box under the inscription *Insert random step number*.
